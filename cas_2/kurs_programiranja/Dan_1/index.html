    <p>Nations of the world record trading activity in their <b><i>balance of payment (BOP)</b></i> ledgers. One of the chief data silos in this item is the "current account," which tracks goods and services leaving (exports) and those entering (imports). The current account shows direct transfers such as foreign aid, asset income such as foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as the BOT.</p>
